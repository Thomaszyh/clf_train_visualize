# clf_train_visualize
This is a package that helps train machine learning classification models and visualize them, saving time in writing visualization code.

The visualization is done mainly using the **confusion matrix** and **ROC curves**, and the scoring results (using **accuracy score** and **AUC values**) are saved in a Python dictionary.
